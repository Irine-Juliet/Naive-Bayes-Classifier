# Question Type Classification

In this small project, I  implement a Naive Bayes classifier for classifying question types, and evaluate the performance of the classifier.

## Setup

I used the TREC question classficiation dataset by [Xin and Roth, 2001](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C02-1150)

### Dataset Description

The Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Question Classification dataset contains 5500 labeled questions in training set and another 500 for test set.

The dataset has 6 coarse class labels and 50 fine class labels. I only used the course class labels.

I used a small sample from the dataset.
